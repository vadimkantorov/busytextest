This thesis describes three research projects I worked on during 2012-2022:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Video clip classification using motion vectors estimated by video codecs at encoding time for speeding-up motion feature computation
\item Weakly-supervised object detection using contast cue as guidance
\item Pretraining the detection head in addition to the backbone for improving object detection and instance segmentation
\end{enumerate}
