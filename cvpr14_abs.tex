Local video features provide state-of-the-art performance for action recognition. While the accuracy of action recognition has been continuously improved over the recent years, the low speed of feature extraction and subsequent recognition prevents current methods from scaling up to real-size problems. We address this issue and first develop highly efficient video features using motion information in video compression. We next explore feature encoding by Fisher vectors and demonstrate accurate action recognition using fast linear classifiers. Our method improves the speed of video feature extraction, feature encoding and action classification by two orders of magnitude at the cost of minor reduction in recognition accuracy. We validate our approach and compare it to the state of the art on four recent action recognition datasets.
