We present an efficient method for extracting and encoding local video descriptors for action recognition. We show that sparse motion vectors from video compression enable accurate action recognition at reduced computational cost. We next apply and evaluate Fisher vector encoding for action recognition and demonstrate the improved speed and accuracy.
%Our efficient implementation of Fisher vector encoding, taking explicit care of space-time pyramids and selecting mixture components with FLANN, boosts accuracy and runs as fast as conventional histogram encoding with FLANN. 
%We also address the problem of high dimensionality of Fisher vector signatures, and show drastic improvements in the size of FV using PCA. 
Our method is fast and enables accurate action recognition using linear classifiers. Implementation of our method is available from~\cite{projectpage}.

%evaluate applicability of PCA and present the scheme that compresses Fisher vector signatures from $2.5M$ to $1.5K$ ($\sim1000x$) values. Linear kernel is a natural choice for Fisher vectors\cite{Sanchez13} which makes classification instant. Particular variants of our system (like VLAD) run $\sim100$ faster than \cite{Wang11} and open doors to video analysis at larger scale.
